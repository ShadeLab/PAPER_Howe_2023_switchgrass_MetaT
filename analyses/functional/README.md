This folder contains the functional annotation scripts that were used to analyze MAG functional annotations and also generate the figures in the manuscript. 

The analysis files which are too large to host on Github are here:

Coverage tables for metagenome contigs mapped to MAGs (contigs-median-bp-normalized.csv) and metatranscriptome ORFs mapped to MAGS (orfs-normalized-median-metat-no-fungal.txt) are included here but also in the larger analysis folder (https://iastate.box.com/s/k2hwzj6uah5iclcpihbgzu6bqjf8ywyv).
